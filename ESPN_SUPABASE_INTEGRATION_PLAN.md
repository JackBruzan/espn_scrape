# ESPN Supabase Integration Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the development tickets required to integrate ESPN API data into the existing Supabase database. The integration will focus on player matching, data storage, and maintaining data consistency between ESPN and the existing fantasy football database.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Database Structure
- **Players Table**: 4,095 records with multiple external IDs (sleeper_id, pfr_player_code, fantasy_sharks_player_id)
- **PlayerStats Table**: 41 records with JSONB columns for passing, rushing, receiving stats
- **Teams/Positions**: Reference tables for normalization

### ESPN Data Structure
- **Player Model**: Contains ESPN player ID, names, team, position, active status
- **PlayerStats Model**: Comprehensive game statistics with multiple stat categories

### Integration Challenges
1. **Player Matching**: Need to link ESPN players to existing database players
2. **Data Schema**: Current PlayerStats table may need enhancement for ESPN data structure
3. **Data Synchronization**: Ensure data consistency and avoid duplicates
4. **Performance**: Bulk operations for large datasets

## Development Tickets

## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1: Database Schema & Infrastructure

### TICKET-001: Add ESPN Player ID to Players Table
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours  
**Dependencies**: None

#### Objective
Add ESPN player ID column to the Players table to enable linking between ESPN data and existing players.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add `espn_player_id` column to Players table (TEXT, nullable, indexed)
- [ ] Create database migration for the schema change
- [ ] Add unique constraint on espn_player_id where not null
- [ ] Update any existing queries that reference the Players table

#### Implementation Details
```sql
-- Migration: add_espn_player_id_to_players.sql
ALTER TABLE "Players" 
ADD COLUMN espn_player_id TEXT NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_players_espn_player_id 
ON "Players"(espn_player_id) 
WHERE espn_player_id IS NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE "Players" 
ADD CONSTRAINT uk_players_espn_player_id 
UNIQUE (espn_player_id);
```

#### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for migration rollback
- [ ] Integration tests for Players table queries with new column
- [ ] Performance tests for index effectiveness

---

### TICKET-002: Enhance PlayerStats Table for ESPN Data
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies**: TICKET-001

#### Objective
Modify the PlayerStats table to accommodate ESPN-specific data structure and improve data organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add ESPN-specific columns for better data tracking
- [ ] Create optimized indexes for query performance  
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- [ ] Support both existing JSON structure and new ESPN structure

#### Implementation Details
```sql
-- Migration: enhance_playerstats_for_espn.sql
ALTER TABLE "PlayerStats" ADD COLUMN espn_player_id TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE "PlayerStats" ADD COLUMN espn_game_id TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE "PlayerStats" ADD COLUMN season INTEGER NULL;
ALTER TABLE "PlayerStats" ADD COLUMN week INTEGER NULL;

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_playerstats_espn_player_id ON "PlayerStats"(espn_player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_playerstats_espn_game_id ON "PlayerStats"(espn_game_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_playerstats_season_week ON "PlayerStats"(season, week);
CREATE INDEX idx_playerstats_composite ON "PlayerStats"(espn_player_id, season, week);

-- Foreign key to Players table
ALTER TABLE "PlayerStats" 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_playerstats_espn_player_id 
FOREIGN KEY (espn_player_id) 
REFERENCES "Players"(espn_player_id);
```

#### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all new columns
- [ ] Migration tests (up and down)

### TICKET-003: Create ESPN Player Matching Service
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours  
**Dependencies**: TICKET-001

#### Objective
Develop a service to intelligently match ESPN players with existing database players using multiple data points.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement fuzzy name matching algorithm
- [ ] Use team and position for additional matching confidence
- [ ] Handle edge cases (traded players, name variations, etc.)
- [ ] Provide confidence scoring for matches
- [ ] Support manual review for low-confidence matches
- [ ] Log all matching decisions for audit

#### Implementation Details
**File: `Services/EspnPlayerMatchingService.cs`**
```csharp
public interface IEspnPlayerMatchingService
{
    Task<PlayerMatchResult> FindMatchingPlayerAsync(Player espnPlayer);
    Task<List<PlayerMatchResult>> FindMatchingPlayersAsync(List<Player> espnPlayers);
    Task<bool> LinkPlayerAsync(long databasePlayerId, string espnPlayerId);
    Task<List<UnmatchedPlayer>> GetUnmatchedPlayersAsync();
}

public class PlayerMatchResult
{
    public long? DatabasePlayerId { get; set; }
    public string EspnPlayerId { get; set; }
    public double ConfidenceScore { get; set; }
    public MatchMethod MatchMethod { get; set; }
    public List<string> MatchReasons { get; set; }
    public bool RequiresManualReview { get; set; }
}

public enum MatchMethod
{
    ExactNameAndTeam,
    FuzzyNameAndTeam,
    ExactNameAndPosition,
    FuzzyNameOnly,
    ManualLink
}
```

**Key Matching Logic:**
1. **Exact Match**: First name + Last name + Team abbreviation
2. **Fuzzy Match**: Levenshtein distance < 2 for names + Team/Position
3. **Position Validation**: Ensure positions are compatible
4. **Team History**: Check for recent trades/transfers

#### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all matching algorithms
- [ ] Integration tests with database
- [ ] Performance tests with large datasets
- [ ] Edge case tests (special characters, Jr/Sr, etc.)

#### Implementation Details
**File: `Services/EspnStatsTransformationService.cs`**
```csharp
public interface IEspnStatsTransformationService

    public int? Week { get; set; }
    
    // Existing JSONB fields enhanced
    public object? Passing { get; set; }
    public object? Rushing { get; set; }
    public object? Receiving { get; set; }
}
```

#### Data Transformation Rules
1. **Stat Categories**: Map ESPN passing, rushing, and receiving stats to appropriate JSONB fields
2. **Data Types**: Convert ESPN values to appropriate database types
3. **Missing Data**: Use null for missing optional fields, defaults for required
4. **Validation**: Ensure realistic ranges for all statistics
5. **Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate stat entries for same player/game

#### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all transformation methods
- [ ] Validation tests for edge cases and invalid data
- [ ] Performance tests for batch operations
- [ ] Data integrity tests
- [ ] Regression tests for existing data compatibility
